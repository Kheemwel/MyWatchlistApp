# My Watchlist App

My Watchlist is a simple and intuitive app designed to help you manage your list of movies and series. With this app, you can easily keep track of what youâ€™ve watched and plan what you want to watch next.

The app was created out of a personal need for a dedicated watchlist manager. I had been using Google Keep to track my watchlist, but I found it inefficient. This inspired me to develop this app.
